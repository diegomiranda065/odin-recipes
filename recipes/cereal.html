    <p>This is a recipe to make a simple bowl of <strong>cereal</strong>. 
       I like this recipe because it is one of those things you can whip up in a matter of minutes.
       Cereal with milk is one of those slept on dishes that only true alpha males eat because
       it saves time and money so you can focus on your true passion which is making money.</p>
